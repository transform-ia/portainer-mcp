# 202503-1: Using an external tools file for tool definition

**Date**: 29/03/2025

## Context

The project needs to define and maintain a set of tools that interact with
Portainer. Initially, these tool definitions could have been hardcoded within
the application code.

## Decision

Tool definitions are externalized into a separate `tools.yaml` file instead of
maintaining them in the source code.

## Rationale

1. **Improved Readability**
   - Tool definitions often contain multi-line descriptions and complex
     parameter structures
   - YAML format provides better readability and structure compared to in-code
     definitions
   - Separates concerns: tool definitions from implementation logic

2. **Dynamic Updates**
   - Allows modification of tool descriptions and parameters without rebuilding
     the binary
   - Enables rapid iteration on tool definitions
   - Particularly valuable when experimenting with LLM interactions, as
     descriptions can be optimized for AI comprehension without code changes

3. **Maintenance Benefits**
   - Single source of truth for tool definitions
   - Easier to review and validate changes to tool definitions
   - Simplified version control for documentation changes

4. **Version Management**
   - External file format may need versioning as schema evolves
   - Requires consideration of backward compatibility
   - Enables tracking of breaking changes in tool definitions

## Trade-offs

### Benefits

- More flexible maintenance of tool definitions
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier experimentation with LLM-optimized descriptions
- Independent evolution of tool definitions and code
- Improved visibility and security through externalized tool definitions, making
  it easier for users to audit and understand potential prompt injection risks

### Challenges

- Need to handle file loading and validation
- Must ensure file distribution with the binary
- Additional complexity in version management
