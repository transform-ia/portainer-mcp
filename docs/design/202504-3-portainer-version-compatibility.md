# 202504-3: Pinning compatibility to a specific Portainer version

**Date**: 08/04/2025

### Context

Portainer server does not implement API versioning, making it challenging to
ensure compatibility between our software and different Portainer server
versions. Each version of Portainer may have different API behaviors and
endpoints, which could cause runtime errors or unexpected behavior if not
properly managed.

### Decision

Maintain independent versioning for this software while explicitly pinning
compatibility to a specific Portainer server version. The software will validate
the Portainer server version at startup and fail fast if the detected version
does not match the required version exactly. Documentation will clearly indicate
which exact Portainer version is supported by each software release.

### Rationale

1. **Independent Release Cycle**
   - Software can be updated outside of the Portainer release lifecycle
   - Allows for bug fixes and features without waiting for Portainer releases
   - Enables more frequent iterations and improvements

2. **Exact Compatibility**
   - Each release will document the specific Portainer version it supports
   - Strict version checking at startup prevents compatibility issues
   - Ensures 100% compatibility with the supported API endpoints

3. **SDK Alignment**
   - Software will use a Go SDK version that matches exactly the supported
     Portainer version
   - Creates a precise binding between SDK capabilities and software
     functionality
   - Eliminates ambiguity about supported functionality

4. **Error Prevention**
   - Early validation of the exact Portainer version prevents any API
     compatibility issues
   - Users receive clear error messages when the version doesn't match
   - Completely eliminates support requests related to API incompatibilities

### Trade-offs

**Benefits**

- Flexible release schedule independent of Portainer
- Absolute certainty about compatibility requirements
- Fail-fast behavior for unsupported versions
- Predictable behavior with supported Portainer version
- Simplified testing against a single Portainer version

**Challenges**

- Users must upgrade/downgrade Portainer to the exact supported version
- Each software release requires a new version when supporting a new Portainer
  version
- More restrictive for users who can't easily change their Portainer version
- Overhead of version validation at startup
- Need to clearly communicate the exact supported version in all documentation
