# Portainer MCP Client and Model Usage Guide

This document clarifies the different client implementations and model
structures used within the `portainer-mcp` project to prevent confusion and aid
development.

## Overview

The project interacts with the Portainer API using two main client layers and
involves two primary sets of data models:

1. **Raw Client & Models:** Provided by the `portainer/client-api-go` library.
2. **Wrapper Client & Local Models:** Defined within
   `portainer-mcp/pkg/portainer/`.

Understanding the distinction and interaction between these layers is crucial.

## Clients

### 1. Raw Client (`portainer/client-api-go/v2`)

- **Package:** `github.com/portainer/client-api-go/v2`
- **Role:** This is the underlying library that directly communicates with the
  Portainer API.
- **Usage:** It's instantiated within the Wrapper Client. It's also often used
  directly within **integration tests** (`tests/integration/`) to fetch the
  ground-truth state from Portainer for comparison against the MCP handler's
  output.
- **Models Used:** Interacts primarily with the Raw Models defined in
  `github.com/portainer/client-api-go/v2/pkg/models`.

### 2. Wrapper Client (`portainer-mcp/pkg/portainer/client`)

- **Package:** `github.com/portainer/portainer-mcp/pkg/portainer/client`
- **Role:** This client acts as an **abstraction layer** on top of the Raw
  Client. Its primary purposes are:
  - To simplify the interface exposed to the rest of the `portainer-mcp`
    application (specifically the MCP server handlers in `internal/mcp/`).
  - To perform necessary **data transformations**, converting Raw Models from
    the API into the simpler, tailored Local Models.
  - To encapsulate common logic or error handling related to Portainer API
    interactions.
- **Usage:** This is the client used by the **MCP server handlers**
  (`internal/mcp/server.go` instantiates it and passes it to handlers).
- **Models Used:** Takes Raw Models as input from the Raw Client but typically
  **returns Local Models** (`portainer-mcp/pkg/portainer/models`) after
  performing conversions.

## Models

### 1. Raw Models (`portainer/client-api-go/v2/pkg/models`)

- **Package:** `github.com/portainer/client-api-go/v2/pkg/models`
- **Role:** These structs directly map to the data structures returned by the
  Portainer API.
- **Characteristics:** Can be complex, may contain fields not relevant to MCP,
  and might use types (like numeric enums) that are less convenient for MCP's
  purposes.
- **Examples:** `models.PortainereeSettings`, `models.PortainereeEndpoint`.
- **Usage:** Returned by the Raw Client, used as input to the conversion
  functions within the Wrapper Client / Local Models package.
- **Naming Convention:** To improve clarity, variables holding instances of
  these Raw Models are typically prefixed with `raw` (e.g., `rawSettings`,
  `rawEndpoint`).

### 2. Local Models (`portainer-mcp/pkg/portainer/models`)

- **Package:** `github.com/portainer/portainer-mcp/pkg/portainer/models`
- **Role:** These are simplified, tailored structs designed specifically for use
  within the `portainer-mcp` application and for exposure via the MCP tools.
- **Characteristics:** Simpler structure, contain only relevant fields, often
  use more convenient types (like string enums).
- **Examples:** `models.PortainerSettings`, `models.Environment`,
  `models.EnvironmentTag`.
- **Usage:** Returned by the Wrapper Client, used within MCP server handlers,
  and ultimately determine the structure of data returned by MCP tools.

### 3. Conversion Functions

- **Location:** Typically reside within `portainer-mcp/pkg/portainer/models`.
- **Role:** Bridge the gap between Raw Models and Local Models.
- **Examples:** `ConvertSettingsToPortainerSettings`,
  `ConvertEndpointToEnvironment`.
- **Usage:** Called by the Wrapper Client methods to transform data before
  returning it. The function parameters accepting Raw Models typically follow
  the `raw` prefix naming convention (e.g.,
  `func ConvertSettingsToPortainerSettings(rawSettings *apimodels.PortainereeSettings)`).

## Typical Workflow Example (`GetSettings`)

1. **MCP Handler (`internal/mcp/settings.go`)**: Receives a tool call.
2. Calls `s.cli.GetSettings()`. Here, `s.cli` is an instance of the **Wrapper
   Client** (`PortainerClient`).
3. **Wrapper Client (`pkg/portainer/client/settings.go`)**: Its `GetSettings`
   method is executed.
4. Calls the **Raw Client**'s `GetSettings` method (e.g.,
   `c.cli.GetSettings()`).
5. Raw Client interacts with the Portainer API and returns a **Raw Model**
   (`*portainermodels.PortainereeSettings`).
6. Wrapper Client calls the **Conversion Function**
   (`models.ConvertSettingsToPortainerSettings`) with the Raw Model.
7. Conversion Function returns a **Local Model** (`models.PortainerSettings`).
8. Wrapper Client returns the Local Model to the MCP Handler.
9. MCP Handler marshals the **Local Model** (`models.PortainerSettings`) into
   JSON and returns it as the tool result.

## Import Conventions

To improve clarity, especially in files where both model types might appear
(like tests), consider using consistent import aliases. Leaving the local
`portainer-mcp/pkg/portainer/models` package as the default `models` and
aliasing the external library is recommended:

```go
import (
    "github.com/portainer/portainer-mcp/pkg/portainer/models" // Default: models (Local MCP Models)
    apimodels "github.com/portainer/client-api-go/v2/pkg/models"      // Alias: apimodels (Raw Client-API-Go Models)
)
```

This approach keeps code cleaner for the more frequently used local models while
clearly indicating when the raw API models are involved.

## Testing Implications

- **Unit Tests** (like `pkg/portainer/client/settings_test.go`): Should mock the
  Raw Client interface and verify that the Wrapper Client correctly calls the
  Raw Client and performs the necessary conversions, returning the expected
  Local Model.
- **Integration Tests** (like `tests/integration/settings_test.go`):
  - Call the MCP handler, which uses the Wrapper Client internally and returns
    JSON representing a Local Model.
  - Often need to _also_ call the Raw Client directly to get the ground-truth
    state from the live Portainer instance (variables holding this state should
    follow the `raw` prefix convention, e.g., `rawEndpoint`).
  - May need to manually apply the same Conversion Function to the Raw Model
    obtained from the Raw Client to create an expected Local Model for
    comparison against the handler's result.

By understanding these distinct layers and their interactions, development and
testing within `portainer-mcp` should be clearer.
